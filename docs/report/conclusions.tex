\section{Conclusions}
Our study has shown how the customers' experienced waiting time is related to the factors of the systems. Obvious relationships have been confirmed, like those related to cashier and kitchen rate. 
Furthermore, we showed that, counter-intuitively, the mean queue length at the kitchen is not influenced by the speed of the cashier (in the considered exponential scenario). 
We also showed that the number of VIP customers over the total can negatively impact the satisfaction of normal customers.

The possibility of introducing priority queuing also in the kitchen has been explored. On the one hand, it obviously increases the benefits of the VIP user but, on the other hand, it reduces normal customers satisfaction. Nevertheless, we showed how this increased waiting time is negligible, therefore the suggestion is to adopt priority queuing also in the kitchen.

Finally, by studying a classic business day, we showed how small improvements in the cashier serving speed can have huge benefits on the overall customer experience.
